domain is given for the period of last decade. From the given data retrieve

(market_fact, cust_dimen, orders_dimen, prod_dimen, shipping_dimen)
2. Find the top 3 customers who have the maximum number of orders
3. Create a new column DaysTakenForDelivery that contains the date difference

came back every month over the entire year in 2011
8. Retrieve month-by-month customer retention rate since the start of the

Tips:
#1: Create a view where each user’s visits are logged by month, allowing for
the possibility that these will have occurred over multiple # years since
whenever business started operations
# 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each
month, we see when the next visit is.
# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and
NULL as churned
# 5: calculate the retention month wise.
