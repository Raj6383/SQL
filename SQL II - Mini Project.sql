-- Tips:
-- #1: Create a view where each userâ€™s visits are logged by month, allowing for
-- the possibility that these will have occurred over multiple # years since
-- whenever business started operations
-- # 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each
-- month, we see when the next visit is.
-- # 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
-- # 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and
-- NULL as churned
-- # 5: calculate the retention month wise
